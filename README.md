# SMART-IRRIGO-2.0-
This is my first Project which is based on Smart IrrigationThe project consists of one Arduino UNO board, one water pump, one soil moisture sensor, and one relay module. We have to insert the soil moisture sensor deep inside the soil and the water pump must be connected to some water tank.
